Introduction:

This program creates a kernel module that displays the system time
variables tv_usec and tv_sec in a /proc file called /proc/TimeFile

The intention of the program was to create a clearly understandible
example of a kernel module that can access kernel variables and
create readable proc files. The source is sparsly commented as it 
is expected that a user will be using more resources to create
their kernel module than this program alone.

This code was created for and tested with the linux kernel version 
2.4.3 and gcc version 2.95.4.

This is free software and is released under the GNU GPL; see the
file COPYING for details.


Quick Start:

Typing 'make' in this directory will compile the source into
the loadable module which will have a .o extension.  

'make load' will load the module.  This must be done as root.

'make unload' will unload the module.  This must be done as root.

'make clean' will simply delete the compiled module.

After the module is loaded there will be a file called /proc/TimeFile
which will contain information described above.  When the module
is unloaded this file is destroyed.  It doesn't get any more simple
than that.
